## Surface Account Lockout State in Custom UIs

<!-- TODO: Document account lockout thresholds, progressive delays, and how
     Clerk signals lockout state. Show how to surface lockout messaging in
     custom UIs. Include how prebuilt components display this automatically
     and what status codes / error objects to check for in custom flows. -->
