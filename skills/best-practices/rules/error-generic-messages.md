## Use Generic Error Messages to Prevent User Enumeration

<!-- TODO: Document the principle of generic error messages that don't reveal
     user existence. Show Clerk's error object structure (clerkError.errors[])
     and how to map codes to user-friendly messages without leaking info.
     Include incorrect vs correct examples of sign-in error handling. -->
